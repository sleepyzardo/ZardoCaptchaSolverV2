# ZardoCaptchaSolverV2

This is an Improved version of my previous recaptcha/cloudfare solver. The techniques used in this once have allowed it to peak solving captchas at sub 2 seconds even.<br>
**THIS IS AN API, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE MINIMUM KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO USE THIS. NO QUESTIONS RELATED TO CODING WILL BE ENTERTAINED.**<br>
This program is updated for new cloudfare as of 22nd June 2024.
## Features
- Fully Automated Captcha Solving.
- Comes with a json-response system, meaning you can display it however you want.
- Under 15s solving speed without proxies on a cold start.
- Under 5s solving speed when solving continuosly.
- Newbie friendly.
- Requires very less coding knowledge.
- Very affordable.
- Can be implemented as an API/Bot/Autocatcher.



## Pricing
Zardo and the associates do not provide any subscription based service for this program. If you wish to buy it, it has to be the source code. This however is subjected to change.

- $7 for the source code along with the practices involved to carry out safe execution.
- $10 for the Captcha-Bypass implemented (applies to every site).

> Prices are subjected to change.

## Free-Trial? [ON PAUSE]
Free trial for the service is possible, A bot will be added to the server which will scan the captcha links sent. Please come prepared for account with captcha enabled incase you want to see the legitimacy.

> *Due to misuse, Maximum of 2 solves will be provided as a proof of legitimacy.*
